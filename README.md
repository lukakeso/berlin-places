# Berlin Places Map

An interactive web map of the locations featured in the book **"Places — Vergangene Orte der Berliner Club- und Subkultur"** by [Tine Fetz](http://www.tinefetz.net/index.php/about/) and Daniel Schneider, published by [Ventil Verlag](https://www.ventil-verlag.de/titel/1919/places).

## About the Book

*Places* documents the forgotten venues of Berlin's club and subculture scene — the abandoned factories, makeshift bars, and basement clubs that shaped the city's underground identity from the 1980s onward. Written by **Tine Fetz** and **Daniel Schneider**, the book pairs personal accounts and photographs with the addresses of 60 locations scattered across the city, many of which no longer exist in their original form.

The book is published by **Ventil Verlag**, an independent publisher based in Mainz specializing in music, subculture, and social movements.

## About this Project

This map is a hobby project. I love the book and wanted to give its stories an interactive dimension — a way to read stories and browse the locations on an actual map of Berlin, and get a feel for just how spread out (and how layered) the city's underground history really is.

If the book resonates with you even half as much as it did with me, I hope this map helps bring Berlin's underground stories to more people.
